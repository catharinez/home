		<h2 id="early_years">Debut, Training, and Early Years (2010-2014)</h2>
		
		<p>In 2010, the CEO of Big Hit Entertainment, Bang Si-hyuk, met the group's leader, RM. Bang Si-hyuk was impressed by RM's rapping skills. This was when the formation of BTS started. The group that the company created was originally meant to debut in 2011 with a different lineup, but the lineup was finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook in 2012. A few months before their debut, several of their song covers on social media platforms started to gain attention.</p>
			
		<p>On June 12, 2013, BTS debuted with their first single album “2 Cool 4 Skool”. The title track of this album was “No More Dream”. This album topped the music charts at number five in South Korea. Although this album only sold 24,000 copies in the year it was released, not long after over 145,000 copies ended up being sold. In 2014, “No More Dream” was recorded in Japanese and released in June.</p>
		
		<p>“O!RUL8,2?”, the second part of their school trilogy, was released on September 13, 2013. The EP's title track “N.O” reached number 92 on music charts in Korea, and the EP reached number four in Korea. Selling 34,000 copies in its release year, it soon sold over 160,000 copies by 2018. By the end of the year, BTS received several new artist of the year awards.</p>

		<p>On February 12, 2014, “Skool Luv Affair” was released. This EP was the last EP of their school trilogy. Over 100,000 copies were sold in 2014, and by 2018, over 250,000 copies were sold. The album's success caused BTS to have their first appearance on Billboard's World Albums Chart. Soon after the album's release, BTS also held their first fan meeting and concert. In March, the group held their first fan meeting in Seoul with about 3000 fans attending. July in the same year, BTS also held a concert in West Hollywood.</p>
		
		<p>“Dark & Wild” was their first Korean studio album. The two leading singles, “Danger” and “War of Hormone”, peaked number 58 and number 173 on Korean music charts. The album sold over 200,000 copies by 2017. The theme of the album and its lyrics were based on expressing maturing, desires, and romance. BTS performed at several Korean music shows and had their first concert tour, 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet. In the same year, the group's first Japanese studio album, “Wake Up” was released on December 24. To help promote the album, BTS held their first Japan tour in February of 2015, 1st Japan Tour 2015 Wake Up: Open Your Eyes. Following their first Japan tour, a solo concert was also held in Korea.</p>
		
		<p>To express the beauty and anxiousness of youth, BTS released the EP “The most beautiful moment in life Pt.1”. This album was included as the only Korean album in Fuse's list of the “27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far”. “The most beautiful moment in life Pt.2” and “The most beautiful moment in life : Young Forever” were also released. One of the lead singles, “I Need U” hit top five in Korea. At the time, BTS was supposed to disband, but after the release of “I Need U” and its great success, the members chose to renew their contracts. “Dope” was popular B-side of the album. Many say that “Dope” is even more popular than the title track, “I Need U”. BTS got their first music show win with “I Need U” on SBS MTV's The Show. In October of 2015, the “I Need U” MV was BTS' first music video to surpass 100 million views on YouTube. They then had another world tour 2015 Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet. Not long after, they performed at Japan's Summer Sonic Festival.</p>
