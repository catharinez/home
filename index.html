		<h2 id="early_years">Debut, Training, and Early Years (2010-2014)</h2>
		
		<p>In 2010, the CEO of Big Hit Entertainment, Bang Si-hyuk, met the group's leader, RM. Bang Si-hyuk was impressed by RM's rapping skills. This was when the formation of BTS started. The group that the company created was originally meant to debut in 2011 with a different lineup, but the lineup was finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook in 2012. A few months before their debut, several of their song covers on social media platforms started to gain attention.</p>
			
		<p>On June 12, 2013, BTS debuted with their first single album “2 Cool 4 Skool”. The title track of this album was “No More Dream”. This album topped the music charts at number five in South Korea. Although this album only sold 24,000 copies in the year it was released, not long after over 145,000 copies ended up being sold. In 2014, “No More Dream” was recorded in Japanese and the Japanese version was released in June 2014.</p>
		
		<p>“O!RUL8,2?”, the second part of their school trilogy, was released on September 13, 2013.

		<p>On February 12, 2014, “Skool Luv Affair” was released. This EP was the last EP of their school trilogy. Over 100,000 copies were sold in 2014, and by 2018, over 250,000 copies were sold. The album’s success caused BTS to have their first appearance on Billboard’s World Albums Chart. Soon after the album’s release, BTS also held their first fan meeting and concert. In March, the group held their first fan meeting in Seoul with about 3000 fans attending. July in the same year, BTS also held a concert in West Hollywood.</p>
		
		<p>“Dark & Wild” was their first Korean studio album. The two leading singles, “Danger” and “War of Hormone”, peaked at number 58 and number 173 on Korean music charts. The album sold over 200,000 copies by 2017. BTS performed at several Korean music shows and had their first concert tour, 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet.

This album was included as the only Korean album in Fuse's list of the 27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far. “The most beautiful moment in life Pt.2” and “The most beautiful moment in life: Young Forever” were also released. One of the lead singles, “I Need U” hit the top five in Korea. At the time, BTS was supposed to disband, but after the release of “I Need U” and its great success, the members chose to renew their contracts. “Dope” was the popular B-side of the album. Many say that “Dope” is even more popular than the title track, “I Need U”. BTS got their first music show win with “I Need U” on SBS MTV's The Show. In October of 2015, the “I Need U” MV was BTS’ first music video to surpass 100 million views on YouTube. They then had another world tour 2015 Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet.

		<p>BTS released “Youth”, their second Japanese studio album, in September 2016. On the day of release, the album reached first on Japan’s music charts. About a month after, pre-orders for BTS’ second Korean studio album, “Wings”, started. Within the first week, over 500,000 copies of the album were sold. In this album, included were solo songs from each of the seven members. Critics, such as Rolling Stone, described it as one of the most conceptually and sonically ambitious pop albums of 2016. It got praised by Fuse for the vulnerable and honest song material. “Blood Sweat & Tears”, the lead single, was a music chart all-kill in South Korea. The music video broke the record on YouTube for the highest number of views of a K-pop group music video in 24 hours by gaining over 6 million views within the first 24 hours. This album marked their first time in surpassing a million album sales. Over 1.5 million copies of the album were sold in South Korea. At the time, it became the best-selling album in Goan Album Chart history at the time. Later in the year, BTS became the first artist who wasn’t from one of the big three companies (SM, YG, and JYP) to win artist of the year at Mnet’s 18th Asian Music Awards.</p>
		
		<p>A repackaged version of “Wings” called “You Never Walk Alone” was released. The repackaged version became the most sold album in a month, with over 700,000 pre-orders.
